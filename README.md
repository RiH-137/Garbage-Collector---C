Try to build a GARBAGE COLLECTOR for C programming language.

1. Understanding Garbage Collection
Garbage collection is like cleaning up after yourself automatically. In programming, when you create objects or allocate memory, you need to make sure you clean up after yourself when you're done using them. If you forget to clean up, it can lead to memory leaks, where memory is allocated but never freed, causing your program to use more and more memory over time.
